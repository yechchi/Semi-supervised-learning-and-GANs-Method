# Semi-supervised-learning-and-GANs-Method

In this project, I present the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) method which is commonly used when there is not enough labeled data and its architecture for image classification. My work is based on a method discussed in a scientific article for the construction of a semi-supervised classification model on the dataset.
